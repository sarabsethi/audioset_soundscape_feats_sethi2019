# audioset_soundscape_feats_sethi2019
Reproducability code for Sethi et. al. 2019 (in prep.)

## Setup
Audio feature data is stored in pickle format - we use Git LFS

## Usage
* Scripts `figure_....py` reproduce figures
* `analysis_libs` and `plot_libs` contain tonnes of functions (mostly unused) but some that are used in figure producing. Obviously needs streamlining before going public
